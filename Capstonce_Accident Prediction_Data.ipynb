{"cells": [{"metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The open dataset of personal road injury accidents in 2019 I am using is published by the UK Department for Transportation and can be accessed under https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data. It includes all personal injury accidents on public roads in the UK reported and recodered using the STATS19 accident reporting form in 2019. A variable lookup guide can be accessed under http://data.dft.gov.uk/road-accidents-safety-data/variable%20lookup.xls. Variables contained are:\n\nAccident Index,\nPolice Force,\nAccident Severity,\nNumber of Vehicles,\nNumber of Casualties,\nDate (DD/MM/YYYY),\nDay of Week,\nTime (HH:MM),\nLocation Easting OSGR (Null if not known),\nLocation Northing OSGR (Null if not known),\nLongitude (Null if not known),\nLatitude (Null if not known),\nLocal Authority (District),\nLocal Authority (Highway Authority - ONS code),\n1st Road Class,\n1st Road Number,\nRoad Type,\nSpeed limit,\nJunction Detail,\nJunction Control,\n2nd Road Class,\n2nd Road Number,\nPedestrian Crossing-Human Control,\nPedestrian Crossing-Physical Facilities,\nLight Conditions,\nWeather Conditions,\nRoad Surface Conditions,\nSpecial Conditions at Site,\nCarriageway Hazards,\nUrban or Rural Area,\nDid Police Officer Attend Scene of Accident,\nLower Super Ouput Area of Accident_Location (England & Wales only)\n\nThe target variable will be Accident Severety with the categories being 1=Fatal, 2=Serious and 3=Slight. Some variables e.g. Police Force getting involved, Number of Casualties cannot be used for predicting the outcome of accidents because they are only determined after the accident and depend instead on the severity of the accident. Others like Date or Longitude and Latidude seem rather useless for prediction. The most promissing are the ones describing the conditions at the site of the accidents, like weather and road conditions."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
