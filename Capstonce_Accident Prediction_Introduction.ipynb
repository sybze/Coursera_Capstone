Policymakers do have a set of tools at hand to reduce the human costs, from expensive measures like stricter car safety regulations or improving the road infrastructure to low cost measures like reduced speed limits. While the latter are cheap to implement, they are equally annoying to motorists. It is therefore important to use sparingly to increase the acceptance and adherence of the drivers. To guide such a targeted approach it is nessary to know under which conditions serious or fatal accidents are most likely to happen. This is what I seek to investigate in this project."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
